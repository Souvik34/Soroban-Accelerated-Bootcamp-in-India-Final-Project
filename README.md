# Stellar-talk

STELLAR TALK is a simple messaging dapp built on Soroban Testnet.

Built using the [@create-soroban-dapp](https://github.com/paltalabs/create-soroban-dapp/) boilerplate and script.

You can find a written [tutorial](https://dev.to/benjaminsalon/sorochat-how-to-build-a-simple-chat-dapp-using-create-soroban-dapp-295l) explaining how to create the dapp on my dev.to ðŸš€
## Build and run

To build the dapp first clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjaminsalon/sorochat.git
```

Then install dependencies using pnpm (or the equivalent commands with your favorite package manager)
```bash
pnpm install
```

Then run

```bash 
pnpm run build
```

And finally run this to start the dapp on local server
```bash
pnpm run start
```
