## Description

Stellar-Talk is a decentralized chat application (DApp) enabling users to communicate securely and transparently on the Stellar blockchain. By connecting through wallets like Freighter or XBull, users can create or join chat rooms, each represented as a smart contract. Messages are broadcast to the network, added to the blockchain as transactions, and become visible to all chat participants. Stellar-Talk ensures message integrity with no central authority, relying on the blockchain as a decentralized ledger. Features include user authentication and message history, providing a robust, peer-to-peer communication platform.

## Vision

Stellar-Talk envisions a future where secure and transparent communication is accessible to all. By leveraging the Stellar blockchain, we eliminate the need for a central authority, ensuring no single party collects or stores user data. This decentralization protects privacy and enhances data security. Stellar-Talk aims to revolutionize the way people communicate by providing a reliable, peer-to-peer platform that fosters trust and integrity. Our mission is to empower users worldwide with a communication tool that guarantees transparency, privacy, and security, making digital conversations safer and more trustworthy.
