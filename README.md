## Description

Stellar-Talk is a chat decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to communicate with each other in a decentralized, and peer-to-peer manner on the Stellar blockchain. The DApp leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide a transparent communication platform.

To use Stellar-Talk, users need to connect to the Stellar blockchain using a wallet such as Freighter or XBull. Once connected, users can create a new chat room or join an existing one. Each chat room is represented as a smart contract on the blockchain, which stores the messages and other relevant data.

When a user sends a message, it is broadcast to the network and added to the blockchain as a transaction. The message is then visible to all participants in the chat room. Since Stellar-Talk is a peer-to-peer DApp, there is no central server or authority that controls the communication. Instead, the blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that records all messages and ensures their integrity.

Stellar-Talk also includes features such as user authentication and message history.

Overall, Stellar-Talk provides a decentralized way for users to communicate with each other, without relying on centralized servers or intermediaries. By using the Stellar blockchain, Stellar-Talk can leverage its fast and low-cost transactions to provide a seamless and efficient communication experience.
